For Protecting our webshop:

we are using: (read this article for it, https://www.codespeedy.com/disable-direct-access-to-the-php-include-file/ )

<?php
  if (basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) == basename(__FILE__)) {
    header('location:../index.php');
  };
?>

to protect so that anyone cannot directly access our views/pages without our consent, or not without going the correct way.

protection on the admin stuff is: (not on the views.. then we are using the above.)

session_start();
if(!isset($_SESSION['user']))
{
  header('Location: ./adminview/adminloginform.php');
}
